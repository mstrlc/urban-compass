Using data.Brno's [Tourist Places dataset](https://data.brno.cz/datasets/mestobrno::turistick%C3%A1-m%C3%ADsta-tourist-places/about), this app helps you find some interesting places in Brno.

It lets you browse the map, finding attractions in your area. The detail view allows you to learn more â€“ see some a photo, read about the attraction, call or email them or visit their website. When you decide to visit, you can find direction in Apple Maps straight from the app.

This app was created as an exercise in Swift and SwiftUI, getting to use new features like MapKit, and attempting to use modern UI elements, like bottom sheets.
The data is pulled from the ArcGIS API, allowing easy expansion to other datasets providing data in the same format in the future.
